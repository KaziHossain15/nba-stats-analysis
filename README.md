This project analyzes NBA player data to identify and visualize the top 10 scorers from each position (Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, and Center) 
based on points per game (PPG). The data is sourced from Basketball Reference (https://www.basketball-reference.com/).

Main features include: 
- Scrapes NBA player stats for the latest season using `pandas` and `requests`.
- Filters players by position and calculates PPG.
- Generates bar charts displaying the top 10 scorers for each position using `matplotlib`.

Steps for installations: 

1. clone the repository.
2. install pandas, matplotlib, requests, and lxml with pip
